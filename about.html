							<h1>About</h1>
							<h2>We Have Free Templates for Everyone</h2>
							<p>
								Welcome to Lifestyle Biking, where we have created two unique bikes, 
								one stationary and one non-stationary, that can recharge themselves 
								while you peddle. By delivering cutting-edge, environmentally friendly
								training equipment, we hope to encourage healthy living and
								sustainability.	
							</p>
							<p>
								Our stationary bike is designed to transform the energy you generate
								while pedalling into electrical energy that is stored in a rechargeable 
								battery. The more energy you generate, the more energy the battery 
								receives. Furthermore, our stationary bike has an interactive display that allows you to track your progress and earn incentives based on how much energy you produce.
							</p>
							<p>
								Our non-stationary bike has similar features, but it also has the advantage of 
								being portable. Because you can charge the battery while riding and utilise the 
								stored energy to power the bike's electric motor, this bike is ideal for commuting 
								or exploring new locations. The non-stationary bike also comes with a GPS tracker 
								and a smartphone app that allows you to track your rides and development.

							<h2>Our Community</h2>
							<p>
								Not only can our rechargeable bikes promote healthy living and 
								sustainability, but they may also be utilized for commuting. You can 
								lower your carbon footprint and contribute to a cleaner, healthier 
								neighborhood by incorporating our bikes into your everyday journey.

							</p>
							<h2>Future Goals</h2>
							<p>
								At Lifesytle Biking, our future goals are to promote healthy living 
								and sustainability on a larger scale. We intend to manufacture and 
								distribute our rechargeable bikes throughout the United States, making
								them available to anyone who wants to improve their health and the 
								environment.
							</p>
							<p>
								We believe that out bikes,have the ability to revolutionise the 
								fitness sector and provide a more sustainable future for future 
								generations. We hope that by broadening our reach, we can encourage
								more people to live a better, more sustainable lifestyle and have a 
								beneficial impact on the world around us.
